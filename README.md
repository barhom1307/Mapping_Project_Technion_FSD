"Real-time path detection for autonomous Formula vehicle" project was developed as a final project in Electrical Engineering Faculty, Technion haifa. 

The project was accompanied by [Vision and Image Sciences Laboratory (VISL)](https://visl.technion.ac.il/projects/2018w02/), and [Technion Formula Student Team](https://www.facebook.com/TechnionFSAE/).

Developed by Aviv Regev & Avinoam Barhom, Supervisor - Danny Veikhrman
